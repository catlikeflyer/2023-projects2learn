# 2023 Open Source/Free Learning Compilation.
Find the best tutorials, videos, courses that'll help you learn and hone your skills in 2023. This repo is a compilation of the best resources I've found on the internet. I'll be adding more resources as I find them. Feel free to contribute and share your knowledge with others.

I'll also be adding project ideas and how to get started for you to put on practice these new skills and attaching the finished versions of the projects.

## Getting Started
Check each of the areas you want to learn and explore the courses. You can also check the [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/) to help you get an idea of where to start or confirm your interests.

## Suggested resources/courses before starting
- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/): They have a variety of programming and coding courses. You can learn everything from HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Java, C++, C#, PHP, SQL, and more. They also have a lot of projects to practice your skills and issue certificates.
- [CS50 by Harvard](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/): The best introductory course to computer science. It covers everything from C programming to data structures and algorithms. 
- [UMich Python for Everybody](https://online.umich.edu/series/python-for-everybody/): Along with CS50, one of the best courses to learn the basics of programming and compsci. Python is gaining popularity when developing servers and APIs, so it's a good idea to learn it.
