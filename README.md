## Disclaimer
This is a personal project to facilitate and share my learning experience with y'all. Everyone learns at different paces and absorbs knowledge at different rates. Each one of you is responsible of what they learn and how they use the knowledge. I am not responsible for any damage caused by the use of this repo. The roadmaps are not perfect nor cover all of the topics. They are just a starting point for you to learn and explore.
