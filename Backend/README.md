# Backend Development
Backend development is the process of converting data to a format that can be stored and accessed by a computer. Backend developers are responsible for the logic of a website, which includes the database, server, and API. They are also responsible for the security of a website, which includes the authentication and authorization of users. Backend developers are also responsible for the performance of a website, which includes the speed of the website and how much data it can handle. Backend development is a very broad field, and there are many different technologies and frameworks.

## Getting Started
### Beginner
- [FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/): Learn the basics of JavaScript, which is the most popular programming language for frontend development. This course is a great place to start if you're new to JavaScript.
- [Craig Dennis APIs for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZvSYJDk-us&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org): Learn the basics of APIs, which are used to communicate between the frontend and the backend. This course is a great place to start if you're new to APIs.


### Intermediate
- [FreeCodeCamp APIs and Microservices](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/apis-and-microservices/): Learn the basics of APIs and microservices, which are used to communicate between the frontend and the backend. This course is a great place to start to implement the beginner knowledge.

### Advanced
Here you should decide what path you want to take. There are many different technologies and frameworks that you can learn, so make sure to do your research before you get going. Here are some of the most popular technologies and frameworks ordered by level of functions capable:
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/): Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/): Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications.
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/): FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/): Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
- [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/): .NET is a free, cross-platform, open source developer platform for building many different types of applications.

Here I can't recommend any specific course, because there are so many of them. A good way to start with each tech stack is to search for a tutorial on YouTube, I'm sure you'll find something.
